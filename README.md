## Centralised bot
Fumabot is a centralised bot, meaning that only one (1) group can control it
per instance of the bot.<br>
The below will detail who can do what with the bot

### Administrators
Administrators are determined by being in a specific list of user IDs. <br>
This list of IDs can only be modified by a user with any of the hard-coded IDs.
Those IDs are, typically the bot developer (me) and the bot owner (sonatadash)

### Access Control
Administrators are capable of issuing bans to users who have been found to be
abusing the bot or otherwise exploiting bugs, or for any other reason that would
have a ban be a fitting handling.<br>

## Installation
Install requirements.txt and run the python file 'bot.py' using
python3.12. Advisable to use a virtual environment.
